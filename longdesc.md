# Rapid Members
Your average economy bot.....<br>***not!***
<br>
We are here to help you have an economy with money actually WORTH something, and with more ways to get coins than cluttering up your server list!<br>
So, you want to know how it works?<br>
## Docs
Staring off is very simple, just use `/earn` to get your base coin! You join the server and you have a coin. Now, what can you do with it?<br>
#### Betting
You can bet that coin! Simply try to get a higher number than the bot in `/bet`. Don't forget you can have a more fair bet with `/flip`.<br>
You kind of want to win, having another coin can unlock many features...
#### Lottery
We have a lottery! It costs `2` coins to enter and can get you a lot of coins!
#### Buying members
Now, to the original reason we started this bot, buying members. Yes, you're going to bring up Members+, but that clutters servers!<br>
Simply type `/buy <member amount>` to buy members! Note the bot isn't that big as of yet and may take a bit of time for the members to arrive.<br>
### Other stuff
Also, joining the support server will get you a free coin!<br>
We do have a `/help` command for you to see what we have.<br>***NOTE THAT THE BOT'S ECONOMY IS LISTED AS 'MEMBERS'.***<br>
Hope to see you invite it!
